# House-Prediction
A model that predicts a house price was built. Linear regression was used for building the model. The house prediction dataset comprises of 20640 rows and 10 columns. Missing data was checked, by using isnul. It was discovered that there were 207 missing data in the total bedroom's column. Exploratory data analysis was performed. Correlation matrix was also performed, and it was seen that the median income, total rooms and housing median age were highly correlated with median house value.

The data was then grouped into target and input feature, also grouped into numerical and categorical feature. The data was then split into the training and test set.

A model was built using linear regression and it had an accuracy of 64.9%
